### Hello 👋

I’m Thomas Padgett, a principal consultant with the operational research group at [HEOR](https://www.heor.co.uk). I'm an ex-aerospace engineer, with a PhD in computational fluid dynamics and agent-based modelling. I'm big on nature, being outside, plants, and mountains. 🌱🌱🌱

### On-going work ✨

 » Multi-indication modelling and pricing.
 » Discrete event simulation for capacity planning.  
 » Machine learning and data analytics using real world data (CPRD/HES).  
 » Public health policy modelling.  
 » Early drug pricing/revenue forecasting, inc. optimisation approaches for market access launch sequencing.
 
### Interests 👀

 » Heuristic optimisation techniques and their application to health.  
 » Health economic evaluations in R/python, particularly simulation (individual-level) models for obesity and diabetes.  
 » Building simple example models on Github for training/education (PSM, cSTM, SEIR, etc.)
